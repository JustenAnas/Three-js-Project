# 🌌 Three.js Planets Showcase

Welcome to the **Three.js Planets Showcase** — a mesmerizing interactive web project built with the power of Three.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and pure JavaScript!

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **4 Stunning Planets**: Explore a miniature solar system featuring four beautifully rendered planets.
- **Smooth Scroll Animation**: As you scroll, watch the planets gracefully move across the screen, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether on desktop or mobile, the layout adapts perfectly to keep the planets looking great on any screen size.
- **Dynamic Planet Names**: The name of each planet updates seamlessly as you scroll, giving life and personality to each celestial body.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Powered by Three.js for 3D graphics, Vite for blazing-fast build and development, and Tailwind CSS for sleek, responsive styling.

## 🌠 How It Works

The planets are rendered with Three.js and animated based on scroll position using JavaScript event listeners. Tailwind CSS ensures the UI stays crisp and responsive, while Vite provides a lightning-quick dev environment to keep the code smooth and efficient.
