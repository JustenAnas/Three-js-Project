# 🌌 Exploring the Universe of Three.js

Welcome to my evolving collection of **Three.js projects**, where creativity meets 3D web visualization!  
Three.js is an amazing JavaScript library that brings immersive 3D graphics to the web, making it possible to create interactive animations, models, and virtual worlds directly in the browser. I’m passionate about crafting visually stunning experiences using Three.js alongside HTML, CSS, and modern frontend tools. This repository serves as the launchpad for my experiments and creative builds in 3D space.

## 🚀 Current Highlights

### 1. Planets Project  
The first star in this constellation is the **Planets Project** — an interactive showcase of four beautifully animated planets that move and reveal their names as you scroll. Built with Three.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, this project is fully responsive and designed to deliver an immersive cosmic experience. Fucking cool project.

### 2. Devbco  
**Devbco** is a sleek and dynamic **Three.js web experience** inspired by the design vibes of *Deveb.co*.  
It blends shaders, gradient transitions, and interactive 3D motion for a visually rich landing page experience.  
This project focuses on smooth performance, elegant UI transitions, and precise motion control — built using **Three.js**, **GSAP**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
